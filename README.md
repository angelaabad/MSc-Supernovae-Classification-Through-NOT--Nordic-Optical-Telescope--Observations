## Abstract
**Aims.** To elaborate the spectral acquisition and classification of the supernovae (SNe) ZTF18aawfqax, ZTF24aambaia and ZTF24aamipnt, previously detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZFT) through photometric techniques. The main purpose con- sisted of the contribution to the effort of categorization and redshift determination of the sources for the survey’s completion. 

**Methods.** The project was carried out through spectroscopic observations conducted remotely from the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) in La Palma (Spain), using the ALFOSC instrument to provide a greater wavelength coverage for enhanced spectral features. The classification of the sources was elaborated applying the typing tool Gelato for an initial categorization and finally SNID for a more reliable spectral verification.

**Results.** According to Gelato, it was estimated that ZTF18aawfqax and ZTF24aambai both belonged to the spectral type Ia SNe (62% and 100% probability percentage respectively), whereas ZTF24aamipn was classified as a type II SN. However, according to SNID, all the three sources were finally classified as type Ia, coherent with previous categorizations. The redshifts derived from SNID (0.054, 0.041 and 0.029, respectively) were also in line with published data.

**Conclusions.** The consistent spectral categorizations achieved with SNID implied this tool provided with higher accuracy results by relying solely on the targets’ spectra and comparing them with sources stored in the database. Consequently, these results enhance the catalog of identified SNe from the ZTF, demonstrating the positive outcomes and efficacy of spectroscopic methods followed during the transients observations. In conclusion, this study could contribute to a broader understanding of SNe properties and perhaps serve as a foundation for future research on the possible evolutionary changes within spectra over time, highlighting potential alterations in the physics and chemistry of SNe environments.
